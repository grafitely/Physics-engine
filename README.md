<h1>Physics engine</h1>

<h3>This is my scuffed physics engine made with no experience in c++ or physics engines, im just gonna make this read me a diary of the development process.</h3>

<h3>Day 1 (Sunday 19th Feb 2023)</h3>

Spent about 2 hours trying to fix a git error with gpg so i could push to the github, fml.
Decided to make this engine with c++ due to that being the most common for physics engines i believe.
Started learning c++.

<h3>Day 2 (Sunday 20th Feb 2023)</h3>

Changed some more gpg config stuff to get a verified mark next to my commits because I thought it looked cool.
Deleted and remade the repo due to some issues with commit history stuff, (test commit for new repo).
installed the c++ compiler MSYS2 Mingw-w64 after a couple hours of effort and made a simple hello world program to get started with c++.

<h3>Day 3 (Sunday 21st Feb 2023)</h3>

Continued to read up on c++ using the w3schools c++ tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp).
nothing much more to development today.

<h3>Day 4 (Sunday 26th Feb 2023)</h3>

Haven't been able to work on the project for the last week but gonna restart working on it now, gonna get back to learning c++ with the w3schools tutorial.
